"Thank you, that makes sense. but now im getting a error when i use this:

for index, row in op_dept.iterrows():
agent = row['visitor_id']
agent_department = requests.get('&lt;https://developer.livehelpnow.net/api/visitor/&gt;'+agent, headers ={'Authorization': token})
found_agent = agent_department.json()
agent_name = found_agent['payload']
agent_name = agent_name['visitor']
agent_name = agent_name['details']
test = found_agent['payload']
test = test['visitor']
test = test['details']

# op_dept['user_issue'] = test[16]['value']
# op_dept['agent_name'] = test[18]['value']

opt_dept[index,'user_issue'] = test[16]['value']"

Hello. I am having some trouble selecting data from Pandas dataframes. How do I select the values from 'NAc Core L' that have 700 as value in the 'Coordinate' column? Thanks!
it'll make reading the code easier

"Yes, that's right. Hence why I went down the route of Huey. I wanted to use celery, because i've used it in the past for other projects. But this problem was worse before.


I believe I am on the latest and greatest.

"Can someone point out what Im doing wrong here, I cant figure it out and its probably something simple. I am trying to sum values in a list of dictionaries but for some reason only the first line of code I am using to sum actually gets summed, the next value is always a zero even when I switch them. I pasted the results below where is show the flip flop but in both cases bothe sums should be equal to 2.

```
grouper = itemgetter(""storeCode"", ""shipDate"", ""shipTime"")
result = []
for key, grp in groupby(sorted(tlog_dict_list, key = grouper), grouper):
temp_dict = dict(zip([""storeCode"", ""shipDate"", ""shipTime""], key))

temp_dict[""salesTrans""] = sum(item[""salesTrans""] for item in grp)
temp_dict[""saleUnits""] = sum(item[""saleUnits""] for item in grp)

pprint(result)
```
```
[{'saleUnits': 0,
'salesTrans': 2,
'shipDate': u'2019-03-05',
'shipTime': u'22:56',
'storeCode': u'52'}]
```

&lt;@Allyson&gt; when I had to write some test for a cli I only tested the handlers and not the arguments themselves. But you might want to ask in #testing_ (it's a channel but slack bug when there is an ending _) :slightly_smiling_face:

"Hi guys,
Do you know if is there a way to read the test cases from a file?

I am using pytest, and at the moment my test looks like this:

```
@pytest.mark.parametrize(""field1, field2"", [

('test 2 log string', ['result', 'expected', 'as', 'a', 'list'),

yea doing that works perfectly

"Question:
In Python 3.6 this code block fails with `complaining that config is not a module`
```Script file: /my_prog/somescript.py
Config files: /myprog/config/config.py
from config.config import Config fails```

In python 3.5 this works.
```
Script file: /my_prog/somescript.py
Config files: /myprog/config/config.py
from config.config import Config fails
```
To make it work on python 3.6 I had to do
`from config import Config`

Anyone happen to know why?"
"wait, so `a.foo` makes foo get reset?"

That is correct. The caller would invoke the `withdraw` method of the account object, which would set the balance internally."
