"Thank you, that makes sense. but now im getting a error when i use this:

agent = row['visitor_id']
agent_department = requests.get('&lt;https://developer.livehelpnow.net/api/visitor/&gt;'+agent, headers ={'Authorization': token})

agent_name = found_agent['payload']
agent_name = agent_name['visitor']
agent_name = agent_name['details']
test = found_agent['payload']
test = test['visitor']
test = test['details']

# op_dept['user_issue'] = test[16]['value']

Hello. I am having some trouble selecting data from Pandas dataframes. How do I select the values from 'NAc Core L' that have 700 as value in the 'Coordinate' column? Thanks!
it'll make reading the code easier

"Yes, that's right. Hence why I went down the route of Huey. I wanted to use celery, because i've used it in the past for other projects. But this problem was worse before.

"Can someone point out what Im doing wrong here, I cant figure it out and its probably something simple. I am trying to sum values in a list of dictionaries but for some reason only the first line of code I am using to sum actually gets summed, the next value is always a zero even when I switch them. I pasted the results below where is show the flip flop but in both cases bothe sums should be equal to 2.

```
grouper = itemgetter(""storeCode"", ""shipDate"", ""shipTime"")
result = []
for key, grp in groupby(sorted(tlog_dict_list, key = grouper), grouper):
temp_dict = dict(zip([""storeCode"", ""shipDate"", ""shipTime""], key))

temp_dict[""salesTrans""] = sum(item[""salesTrans""] for item in grp)
temp_dict[""saleUnits""] = sum(item[""saleUnits""] for item in grp)

pprint(result)
```
```

'salesTrans': 2,
'shipDate': u'2019-03-05',
'shipTime': u'22:56',

"Hi guys,
Do you know if is there a way to read the test cases from a file?

I am using pytest, and at the moment my test looks like this:

"Question:
In Python 3.6 this code block fails with `complaining that config is not a module`
```Script file: /my_prog/somescript.py
Config files: /myprog/config/config.py
from config.config import Config fails```

In python 3.5 this works.
```
Script file: /my_prog/somescript.py
Config files: /myprog/config/config.py
from config.config import Config fails
```
To make it work on python 3.6 I had to do
`from config import Config`

Anyone happen to know why?"
"wait, so `a.foo` makes foo get reset?"

That is correct. The caller would invoke the `withdraw` method of the account object, which would set the balance internally."

given the choice i probably wouldn't have built a regex based NLP system but sometimes you inherit some projects that are wonky as fuck
i fucking love regex
What the fuck did I just read
oh shit! thats great
I just think back to when I was in college taking bullshit GenEd courses
I mean I don't do that but I get that some people just don't give a shit and are forced to for whatever reason

thanks so much I was shitting myself lol
holy shit

well im downloading captchas and shit like that
"Yes you are right people will get demoralised if flagged every single time.
In go project which i worked with we used this check (like a good to have), not to flag things as shitty code.
Like you said before we sit as a team we take a look into code smell and remove it before moving it into production. I am taking that learning into the new project but this is in pyspark and spark sql. So i wanted to know if Sonarqube is the most recommended or just use the basic linter.
I did realize dev team who is in this is not used to these toolings and code quality. So it is a thin line for making people frustrated."
"worse - they may internalized its continued griping about their ""shitty code"" and get demoralized."
is that shitty code fairly visible in review or when working on tickets?
shit one sec
oh shit :o
